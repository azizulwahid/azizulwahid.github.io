# “Will you then let me be free?”
For years, the silent doctrines you instilled shaped my aspirations to mirror yours. Yet, in being you, I lose myself, and you retain your uniqueness. Realization dawns – my liberation doesn't dent your world. Your game, alluring and powerful, continues with or without me. I seek my escape, questioning if freedom means adopting your guise. Must my existence mimic yours for a semblance of life?

# “Looking into the mirror of time”
We are a paradox, simultaneously nascent and ancient. Gazing into your essence is a journey into my own soul. Your presence, a portal to realms both archaic and serene. In the depths, amongst ancient beings, I find a reflection of our genesis, a reminder of our shared origin in the nurturing cradle of water.

# “I am more than what you want me to be”
The realization persists, an ever-shifting tapestry of emotions and interests. We are the antithesis of static, constantly evolving beyond the rigid confines they impose. How can you label a being so dynamic? Attempts to squeeze us into prefabricated molds, born from your comfort, are futile. We defy your boxes, transcending limitations, reveling in our freedom to leave, to be.

# "Justice arrives like a hailstorm"
When homes are reduced to ashes, lives extinguished in a fleeting moment, silence becomes impossible. Countless souls flee their land, now a desolate expanse of blood-soaked dust. Yet, amidst the despair, justice is an unyielding promise, it will arrive. And when it does, it descends like a hailstorm.

# "Coming home, coming back to you”
Your return was cloaked in hesitation, a journey marked by reflections on choices made. As years cascaded like seasons, a profound realization dawned. Now, older and steeped in wisdom, you see the intricate mosaic of your identity. Each piece, a fragment of experiences both near and far, weaves into a portrait of self-realization. 

Had you not journeyed back, had you remained distant, the person you are today would be but a shadow, unanchored from the profound realities and relationships that now define you. 

In this return, you didn't just come back to a place, but to yourself – a self more authentic, more aware of the intricate dance between past and present, home and away.
