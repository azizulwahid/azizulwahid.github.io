Five months out from 26, and here I am, unravelling the tapestry of my 25th year. 25 is an odd age, no doubt. While some friends are reciting vows, others are dancing under neon lights, travelling foreign countries, or embracing the joys of parenthood.

As for me? My days blend into one another, largely punctuated by work. Don't misinterpret this as a lament – my life is in a pretty good place. But there's this tug, this need to decipher the journey: retracing my steps, understanding my now, and plotting the course ahead.

Often, it feels like I'm wandering in a desert of same-old routines, like each day mirrors the last. While the cadence of my days is undeniably repetitive, within that rhythm I've discovered moments of clarity. These moments guide me, teaching when to dive headfirst into the chaos and when to take a step back. And now, more than before, I find myself in the driver's seat, setting the pace of my 25-year-old journey.

25 wasn’t ushered in by some profound epiphany or the mere change of a calendar date last December. It's more a culmination of those mundane choices, introspective nights, and the constant curveballs life throws. It's… very 25, if you ask me.

At 25, I've come to see that life isn’t just about rushing through deadlines or chasing the next job title. It's vast, expansive, and brilliantly intricate. If I think of life as a sprawling canvas, then work is just one shade among many. I want my canvas filled with experiences, laughter, journeys, and memories – a vivid testament that there's so much more to life beyond the daily grind. Although, often, it feels like piecing together a complex jigsaw, and I swear a few pieces are hiding under the couch, hiding just out of reach.

At 25, while settled in the house where all my memories began, something feels off. This place, filled with past laughter and dreams, has lost its familiar warmth. It feels less like the comforting destination I remembered and more like a temporary stopover, a void evident. It's as though even places rich with memories can, at times, feel incomplete.

Thinking of 30 at 25, I hope to find myself in a place where every corner radiates warmth, where every room feels like a long-awaited embrace.
