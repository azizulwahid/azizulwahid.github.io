If you don't get the movie reference in the title, I'm sorry - you might not be as cultured as I am.

It's Maya Bay, just as you see in the picture above.

I won't write much on it because, in all honesty, words can't quite do it justice. The beach is simply stunning. Even the bustling crowds couldn't mask its beauty, a testament to its resilience against the impacts of overtourism that mar so many other destinations in Thailand.

The bay, the archipelago, the crystal-clear water - it was all picture-perfect.

Despite being exhausted from a day filled with island-hopping, even my mom couldn't resist admiring the captivating beauty of this place.

Would I come back? Not in the immediate future, as there isn't a whole lot to do. It's the kind of place you need to visit at least once in a lifetime, then maybe return a decade or two later to appreciate its timeless beauty all over again.
