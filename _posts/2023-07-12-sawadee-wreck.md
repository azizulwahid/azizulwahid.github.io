Waking up surprisingly well-rested – perhaps I was so exhausted from the day before. Around 8, we made our way to the jetty, preparing our gears, and shortly after, we were off.

The first dive brought us to Tokong Timur. The dive was so nice. Today's weather was sunny and warm, and I was so happy, absorbing the sun, appreciating the ocean’s vibrant blue reflecting the sky above. The dive seemed to pass in a blink, likely because I was still half-asleep.

Our second dive took us to Sawadee Wreck. This dive mind-blowingly surpassed my expectations. 

> The descent, a journey 31 meters deep into the ocean, was so magical and captivating. The vast, the emptiness of the blue of the ocean was hypnotic and mesmerizing beyond words. It was peaceful and quiet.

The wreck was larger than I'd anticipated, and the chill at the ocean's bottom only added to the thrill. I loved every moment of this dive. A site I definitely I want to visit again.

For the third dive, we returned to Tokong Timur, and just like the first time, I adored every minute. The descent was amplified by the wave action, adding an exciting twist. It was movie-like, really. The dramatic contrast of the solitary lighthouse atop a small, rocky island piercing the ocean's surface, set against the distant yet greatly blue backdrop of the sky, reminds me of Shutter Island (but on a sunny, joyful day haha).

Due to the craziness of the waves, we did a negative descent and gathered at the bottom, unable to stay on the surface for long.

I love today so much.
