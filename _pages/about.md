Writing is a constant in my life. I pen thoughts daily, on anything and everything, even on the days where not much of note takes place.

It's my way of locking down my thoughts, preserving my memories, so that I can return and reflect on them in the future. It's my way to understand myself better, to revisit my past selves at various stages of life.

Creating this website allows me to consolidate my more finely crafted memories in one location, to share with those who might find joy in reading them. This space is designed to be a public display for the stories I choose to share, while my private writings remain just that - private, accessible only to me.

I've shared some of these writings on platforms like Instagram Stories from time to time, but they never felt quite right there - it's just too much. With so many things happening and scattered content, it wasn't the right home for my stories.

What I really wanted was a space specifically tailored for my writing.

I've always liked the idea of having my own blog and have given it a shot a few times, but it never felt quite right. There was always something that bugged me - the theme, the ridiculous pricing, the watermark (yikes!) or the lack of control over my own site.

So I thought, why not build it myself? Buy my own domain, design it my way, get it up and running, and choose a theme knowing I could alter any component as I saw fit. I wanted full control and freedom over my site, and so I took it.

Thus, Sunset, Seasalt was born. Crafted by me, penned by me, and filled with stories I handpicked to share.

Enjoy!
